# Testing

Let's quickly recap what we've done so far:

- We've built out the necessary components of MorpheusVM
- We've extended our implementation by adding an option which creates a JSON-RPC
  server

In theory, our implementation of MorpheusVM should work exactly like the
canonical version. To put this to the test, we're going to apply the same
workload test used against the canonical version towards our implementation.

This section will consist of the following:

- Implementing a bash script to run our workload test
- Implementing the workload test itself
- Implementing a way to feed our workload test to the HyperSDK workload test
  framework
