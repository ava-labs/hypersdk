//! Welcome to the wasmlanche! This SDK provides a set of tools to help you write
//! your smart-contracts in Rust to be deployed and run on a `HyperVM`.
//!
//! There are three main concepts that you need to understand to write a smart-contract:
//! 1. **State**  
//!    State is the data that is stored on the blockchain. It also follows a schema that you specify with the [`state_schema!`] macro.
//!    <br><br>
//!
//! 2. **Public Functions**  
//!    These are the entry-points of your program. They are annotated with the [`#[public]`](crate::public) attribute.
//!    <br><br>
//!
//! 3. **Context**  
//!    The [Context] provides all access to the outer context of the execution. It is also used to access and set state with the keys defined by your schema.
//!    <br><br>
//! ## Example
//! ```
//! use wasmlanche::{public, state_schema, Address, Context};
//!
//! type Count = u64;
//!
//! state_schema! {
//!     /// Counter for each address.
//!     Counter(Address) => Count,
//! }
//!
//! /// Gets the count at the address.
//! #[public]
//! pub fn get_value(context: &mut Context, of: Address) -> Count {
//!     context
//!         .get(Counter(of))
//!         .expect("state corrupt")
//!         .unwrap_or_default()
//! }
//!
//! /// Increments the count at the address by the amount.
//! #[public]
//! pub fn inc(context: &mut Context, to: Address, amount: Count) {
//!     let counter = amount + get_value(context, to);
//!
//!     context
//!         .store_by_key(Counter(to), counter)
//!         .expect("serialization failed");
//! }
//!
//! # fn main() {}
//! ```
//!
//! ## Hint
//! Use the [dbg!] macro when testing your program, along with the `-- --nocapture` argument to your `cargo test` command.
